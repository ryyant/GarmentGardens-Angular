    <p-card header="Our mission">
      Sustainable apparel are much harder to sell, given the multitude of fast
      fashion options available. Companies producing sustainable apparel
      struggle in terms of generating ROI due to the low profit margin.
      Meanwhile, patrons who frequent sustainable clothing indicate that
      shopping for such apparel is a tedious process, due to the lack of a
      centralised platform. Garment gardens aim to bridge this gap and make
      sustainable clothing convenient to purchase, and easy to sell.
