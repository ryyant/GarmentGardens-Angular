    <p-card class="contentBox" header="Our mission">
        Sustainable apparel are much harder to sell, given the multitude of fast fashion options available. Companies
        producing sustainable apparel struggle in terms of generating ROI due to the low profit margin. Meanwhile,
        patrons
        who frequent sustainable clothing indicate that shopping for such apparel is a tedious process, due to the lack
        of a
        centralised platform. Garment gardens aim to bridge this gap and make sustainable clothing convenient to
        purchase,
        and easy to sell.
